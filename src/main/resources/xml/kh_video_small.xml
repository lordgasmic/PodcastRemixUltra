&lt;h2&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iyaz always wanted to carry a PC in his pocket. He tried out the Handspring Visor paired with a stowaway keyboard, but that was back in the 90s. Multiple vendors tried to miniaturize the PC like OQO or with the UMPC and it just didn't take off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enter MHL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Android phones are coming along with MHL. What is MHL? It is Mobile High-definition Link that lets you get video and audio out of a single port from your phone. Your phone may have MHL and you don't even know it because it uses the MicroUSB connector that ubiquitous on modern phones. &lt;a href="http://meetmhl.com/DoIHaveMHL.aspx"&gt;Find out if your phone is equipped with MHL here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Samsung Galaxy SIII Controversy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our demo, we used a Samsung Galaxy SIII (a very popular phone). However, Samsung uses a different connector to provide MHL out. &lt;a href="http://www.galaxymhl.com/"&gt;Read more about that controversy here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used &lt;a href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=108&amp;cp_id=10833&amp;cs_id=1083314&amp;p_id=10019&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2"&gt;an MHL Adapter for the S3&lt;/a&gt; and then connected that to an &lt;a href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=108&amp;cp_id=10833&amp;cs_id=1083314&amp;p_id=9291&amp;format=2"&gt;MHL to HDMI adapter&lt;/a&gt;. We then connected an HDMI cable from the MHL to HDMI adapter to a television. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also installed a couple of apps to make the experience better. &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher"&gt;Nova Launcher&lt;/a&gt; lets us have a horizontal home screen. Then we also installed &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apedroid.hwkeyboardhelperfree"&gt;Null Input Method&lt;/a&gt;, which lets us remove the onscreen keyboard to free up screen real estate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For inputs, we paired a bluetooth keyboard and mouse. We found a bunch of keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to share a tip based on episode #40 on overclocking. Many notebook manufactors, like LG, Samsung and Dell, downclock the processor speed for ""stability"". The reduction of the speed range between 10% - 30%.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, we're going to take an Android device and make it like a traditional desktop.
 Backstory


Iyaz always wanted to carry a PC in his pocket. He tried out the Handspring Visor paired with a stowaway keyboard, but that was back in the 90s. Multiple vendors tried to miniaturize the PC like OQO or with the UMPC and it just didn't take off.
 Enter MHL


Modern Android phones are coming along with MHL. What is MHL? It is Mobile High-definition Link that lets you get video and audio out of a single port from your phone. Your phone may have MHL and you don't even know it because it uses the MicroUSB connector that ubiquitous on modern phones. Find out if your phone is equipped with MHL here .
 The Samsung Galaxy SIII Controversy


In our demo, we used a Samsung Galaxy SIII (a very popular phone). However, Samsung uses a different connector to provide MHL out. Read more about that controversy here .
 The Setup


We used an MHL Adapter for the S3 and then connected that to an MHL to HDMI adapter . We then connected an HDMI cable from the MHL to HDMI adapter to a television.


We also installed a couple of apps to make the experience better. Nova Launcher lets us have a horizontal home screen. Then we also installed Null Input Method, which lets us remove the onscreen keyboard to free up screen real estate.


For inputs, we paired a bluetooth keyboard and mouse. We found a bunch of keyboard shortcuts.

 What is overclocking?
Overclocking is taking a processor (or a number of other devices) and running it above specified clock rates for increased performance.
In the old days, you'd have to do this via physical switches on the motherboard. These days, you can do it via software. Practically speaking, overclocking a CPU will allow you to get some more performance for things like video editing, video encoding or transcoding and development work.
 Hardware
For our demo, we used the Asus P8Z77-V motherboard, but you can pretty much overclock on any motherboard from Asus or MSI.
You can overclock any Ivy Bridge processor, but Ryan says it's easier with the K-Series (like the 3770K or the 3570K) since these processors are unlocked.
 Software
We're using Asus's Turbo V EVO software that comes with the motherboard we chose. It's also available as a free download (click the + next to Utilities) at Asus.
If you want to get extra performance out of your processor, you don't need to mess with each and every setting available in Turbo V EVO.
 What to mess with
The main things you should take a look at are "BCLCK Frequency," (Base Clock Frequency) which is mixed with a multiplier known as the CPU multiplier. You'll want to adjust the ratio under the CPU Ratio section of the software by moving a slider. Increasing the ratio which change the frequency. If you increase the ratio too much, you could cause a system crash.
There are two ways to determine the best settings: You can do a search for the type of motherboard you have and dive into forums. Alternatively, you can experiment.
If you don't want to fiddle with that you can use the "Auto Tuning" feature of Turbo V EVO that allows the software to handle the process for you, but it might not give you the same performance you'd get by experimenting.
The software will let you save profiles, so you can test out different settings and switch easily.
For our setup, Ryan set the BCLK Frequency to 103.0, the CPU Voltage to 1.290 and the ratio to 44.0. Ryan suggests not increasing the voltage until you see instability.
 Stress testing
We used the System Stability test in AIDA64 to test out our settings. It's safer to test things this way than just running your system only to find out something goes wrong during a mission critical event.

There are lots of different services and we want to be able to find everything one from place. We took a look at a couple of services you can use that will wrangle your cloud storage in a cohesive way.</p><p><h2>Primadesk</h2></p><p><a href="http://primadesk.com">Primadesk</a> lets you add all kinds of accounts from a number of services including Box, Cubby, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, FTPs and even your own PogoPlug.</p><p>The site indexes your content so you can use the search function to find your things. Primadesk also features a File Explorer layout. We found that indexing took a couple of hours and we had issues with indexing Dropbox. Without the index function, the search function is not as useful, but the file explorer works fine.</p><p>Additionally, Primadesk can bring all your email accounts under one roof. Primadesk doesn't store your data on its servers unless you want them to - you can back up your cloud services to Primadesk for a fee.</p><p><h2>CloudMagic</h2></p><p><a href="http://cloudmagic.com">CloudMagic</a> lets you put organize your cloud life as well. It can tie into Google services, Microsoft's SkyDrive, iCloud and more.

There are lots of different services and we want to be able to find everything one from place. We took a look at a couple of services you can use that will wrangle your cloud storage in a cohesive way.

 Primadesk
 Primadesk lets you add all kinds of accounts from a number of services including Box, Cubby, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, FTPs and even your own PogoPlug.
The site indexes your content so you can use the search function to find your things. Primadesk also features a File Explorer layout. We found that indexing took a couple of hours and we had issues with indexing Dropbox. Without the index function, the search function is not as useful, but the file explorer works fine.
Additionally, Primadesk can bring all your email accounts under one roof. Primadesk doesn't store your data on its servers unless you want them to - you can back up your cloud services to Primadesk for a fee.
 CloudMagic
 CloudMagic lets you put organize your cloud life as well. It can tie into Google services, Microsoft's SkyDrive, iCloud and more. We found that CloudMagic indexes content quickly.
CloudMagic displays data in a very visual way with a two pane interface. The right pane shows you a preview of emails or files you have stores with other services. The downside is you get only 50 previews per month for free. $5 per month buys you unlimited previews. CloudMagic's search was very powerful in our tests. It's a great way to find your things.
Additionally, CloudMagic has apps for iOS, Android, and more.
 Desktop Solution
If the thought of giving your credentials to a third party like Primadesk or CloudMagic (who promise they are trying to be as secure as possible) bugs you, you can always install apps for your cloud services. Mac OS X and Windows both have powerful built-in search functions that will allow you to search for your files as long as they are synced to your device.

 What should I know first?



First watch our DD-WRT episode to learn how to install DD-WRT on your devices. This episode will show you how you can take two DD-WRT-enabled routers and create a client bridge between the two of them.



A client bridge will allow you to connect two locations that are far apart wirelessly. So if you had your main router in your office and you needed to attach some home theater components to ethernet in your living room, a client bridge could be used to expand your wireless network.



Start with two routers that support DD-WRT . These two will communicate with each other. After we've modified the routers to make a bridge, we'll take one and attach it to our main network. The other will be placed where you want expanded access.



 The first device



Assuming you have DD-WRT on your device, take your laptop and connect to your access point that will be part of your bridge.



Set up a static IP address on your laptop. Windows Instructions | Mac OS X (look at the bulleted list) . Pick an address that's not used on your network. You don't need to fill out default gateway.



With the laptop attached to your DD-WRT device (the router you will be modifying), open up your web browser and type 192.168.1.1 in the URL bar.



Under Setup &gt; Basic Setup, change your WAN Connection Type to "Disabled." Under Optional Settings, choose a Router Name that lets you know what the device is. We called it "Client Bridge Local." (That's how we'll refer to the device in the rest of these notes)



Under Setup &gt; Basic Setup &gt; Network Setup, put an IP address that's in your network that's not in your DHCP range. To determine your DHCP range, check your router to see what range it supports. For example, if your range goes from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.199, set your Client Bridge Local to 192.168.1.251. Set your Gateway address to your Router's IP address.



Your Client Bridge Local will be attached to your main router. That will bridge to another location.



Under Setup &gt; Basic Setup &gt; Network Address Server Settings, set DHCP Server to "Disable." That's to stop the device from handing out IP addresses that could cause network issues.



Now, we'll go to the Wireless tab of DD-WRT. With our Client Bridge Local, we've got two radios. One that runs on 2.4GHz and another on 5GHz. One radio will be for the bridge, one can be used as an access point for your devices.



As Russell is a professional, he used the Wi-Spy Spectrum Analyzer to see what channels are in use and what's available on your network. The concept is to see what channels are being used near you. Then you can put your devices on a channel that isn't being used by others, which should give you better wireless network speeds. Choose a channel not used by your main wireless router. Your bridge should be on a different channel.



In our setup, Russell disabled the 2.4 GHz wireless radio under Wireless &gt; Basic Settings &gt; Wireless Physical Interface wl0 [2.4 Ghz]. Go to Wireless Network Mode and set that to "Disabled."



Then enable Wireless Network Mode under the Wireless Physical Interface wl1 [5 Ghz]. Then set Wireless Mode to "AP." We're using N-Only because the only other device that connects to the Client Bridge Local will be the other router that we will configure. Russell set up our Channel Width to 40 MHz for faster performance.



While still in the Wireless Physical Interface wl1 [5 Ghz] section, set your Wireless Network Name (SSID). We suggest turning off Wireless SSID Broadcast since you don't want people accidentally connecting to our bridge.



Under Wireless &gt; Wireless Security &gt; Wireless Security wl1, set your Security Mode. We went with WPA2 Personal. This key is important. You'll need this key and the name of the network on your router to make it connect.



We made some tweaks to the advanced settings under Wireless &gt; WL1-Advanced. Under Basic Rates, we switched that to "All." We set CTS Protection Mode to "Disable." Then we enabled Frame Burst. If you want to know why, watch the video, Russell does a great job explaining WHY we did these things.









 TL;DR Version
Take one DD-WRT router, put it on its own IP address, turn off DHCP, set up wireless network name for the bridge, pick the channel, then set a WPA2 security code.



 The second device, the remote unit
Take your laptop to the second router that you will make the other end of your bridge. We'll go to its web interface. The following is similar to the first device. Disable the WAN connection under Setup &gt; Basic Setup. Give the router a name. We called it "Client Bridge Remote." We gave our remote unit the IP address of 192.168.1.252 so you can browse to it later if you want to tinker with the configuration.



Disable the 2.4 GHz radio by setting Wireless Network Mode to "Disabled" in Wireless &gt; Basic Settings &gt; Wireless Physical Interface wl0 [2.4 GHz]



In Wireless &gt; Basic Settings &gt; Wireless Physical Interface wl1 [5 GHz], set Wireless Mode to "Client Bridge" to make a 5 Ghz bridge. Set your Wireless Network Name (SSID) to the same SSID you set for your first unit, the Client Bridge Local. It can be hidden, but type it in the same way.



Under Wireless Security input the same security information you did for the first unit. Set the Security Mode to WPA2 Personal and input the same shared key.



Once you save that, head to Status &gt; Wireless. In our case, because we have a dual radio router, we're going to make sure we've set our interface to wl1 (that's the name of our 5 GHz interface). Under the Wireless Nodes section, you can see your connection metrics.



 TL;DR Version
Take the other DD-WRT router, put it on its on IP address, turn off DHCP by setting it to "Client Bridge" mode, match the SSID to the first unit, and match the Wireless Security information.



 The remote access point
The way we set up things, the remote unit's ethernet ports are active, so you can plug in client devices. If you want to add WiFi to your remote unit, you can attach an access point to your remote unit.



If you've got a dual-band radio, you can go back into your remote unit. In DD-WRT, go to Wireless &gt; Basic Settings and use that 2.4 GHz interface. Set the wireless mode to "AP." Set the Wireless Network Name (SSID) to your main network's SSID. Under Wireless &gt; Basic Settings &gt; Wireless Security, set the same security info as your main network. Your client devices will be able to access your network wherever you roam.



If you don't have a dual-band router, you can alternatively set the remote access point to Client Bridge-Repeater mode.



 Backup your settings
Under the Administration tab in DD-WRT, click Backup. Then backup your your configuration. Be sure that your backup file is clearly labelled and only use it for the specific piece of hardware you've backed up.

We're going to do something Apple hasn't done in a long time - we're going to upgrade a Mac Pro.
 SSD upgrade
The biggest performance boost we saw for the Mac Pro was using the OWC Mercury Accelsior PCI Express SSD . The SSD starts at $300, but Leo picked up the 240GB variety which costs about $470. Boot times were sped up extensively.
Leo opted not to create his own Fusion Drive because he wanted crazy performance. Compared to a traditional HDD, the SSD blew away the read/write speeds of the spinning drive.
 Graphics Cards
Apple officially supports only several graphics cards. Leo picked up the Sapphire Radeon HD 7950 for over $400. According to the benchmarks ran, the Sapphire just didn't perform that much better than the stock card that came with the Mac Pro (from back in 2010).
OS X has recently been able to support graphics cards that were built for Windows. However, in our tests we could not see the results due to a connector issue.

We've got a WeMo at TWiT and we're going to see what it can do.
 The Belkin WeMo
The Belkin WeMo is an internet connected switch. You can pick up a switch and a motion sensor for about $80. Additional switches are $45. The device connects to an iOS or a beta Android app. To extend the function of the WeMo we can use IFTTT, which connects web services to other services like the WeMo.
To find out more about IFTTT, check out Know How... To Make the Web Work for You.
 Connecting to the WeMo
There are a bunch of recipes available for the WeMo already. If you've got a motion sensor, you can receive a text message. Try out this little home security recipe.
If you want your lights to turn on when the sun sets, you can create your own recipe using the weather channel as the trigger and your WeMo. If you just want to use a preexisting recipe - here's one by an IFTTT user by the name of Strong.
 Google Voice Notification
Iyaz wanted to set up a visual notification whenever he received an SMS on Google Voice. You'll need to have the email channel activated in IFTTT. The GMail channel on IFTTT checks for new messages every 15 minutes, so that might not be the best for potentially time sensitive information via text.
Any time you send an email to the IFTTT trigger address, it will turn the WeMo on. Automatically forwarding things via GMail filters or Outlook.com did not provide IFTTT with the proper information.
To get this to work, we had to use an email client. We used Thunderbird and created a rule to forward messages with SMS in the subject to trigger@ifttt.com. From there we went into Account Settings &gt; Server Settings to change the account settings to check mail every 1 minute"

 Collecting Your Photos
Before we organize anything, we should try to get all of our photos in one place. One of the easiest ways to collect all your photos is via Dropbox. If you're unfamiliar with Dropbox, it is an online storage locker for your files. You get 2GB of storage for free. Find out more about Dropbox here . Here's a signup link to Dropbox.
Dropbox recently introduced a feature called "Camera Upload." If you have the Dropbox app on your iOS or Android device, you can have any photos and videos you take on those devices automatically uploaded to Dropbox. This works great if you have multiple devices like a tablet and a phone. Also, since you're using Dropbox, your files are also available in the cloud, which is always nice for backup.
You can also grab any photos you're tagged in on Facebook using Social Photo Download.
To make sure that any future photos of you are collected, try out IFTT. IFTT stands for "If This Then That," which connects all kinds of web services. In the case you get tagged in Instagram, it can be automatically saved to your Dropbox using this recipe . (IFTT calls its combined services "recipes"). There's a similar one for Facebook - here's the recipe for if tagged in Facebook, then save in your Dropbox. We covered the ways you can use IFTT in "Know How..." episode 20.
Apart from social networks, you might have a bunch of photos in your email. Check out this app called " Lost Photos ." It's free and it searches through your email to find any photos that are in your accounts. It costs $3 on Mac OS X.
 Photo Management
Iyaz recommends Picasa from Google . It is the free software download, not to be confused with Picasa Web (the online photo service from Google). The program is available for Windows and Mac and can even search for duplicate files in your library. If you want to be able to upload your files to more than just Google, try out the Picasa Uploader for Facebook.
Leo really likes Adobe Lightroom as his photo manager. It's incredibly powerful and can handle pretty much any file format you can throw at it. The app works on Windows and Mac and costs a bit over $100. Here's a link if you want to download Adobe Lightroom.
Both Picasa and Lightroom respect whatever your file structure is. They don't move around your pictures to new locations like iPhoto does.
For backup, Leo suggests ChronoSync for Mac ($40) and SyncToy for Windows (free).

You can set up wireless audio in your home on a budget. It might not work as seamless as a Sonos, but it sure is cheaper. Every set up uses two parts -- an audio source and an audio receiver. The audio source could be your phone, your tablet, laptop or desktop.
 Bluetooth
If you just want to connect your audio source to one speaker, Bluetooth is a great option. Bluetooth pairs to one device, and is low power so it doesn't put a huge hit on your phone or tablet's battery life. Audio quality does vary. A2DP Bluetooth does offer higher quality than previous versions. Bluetooth does not support multiple speakers - you can't stream from one device to many speakers at the same time.
 Networked solutions
You can use your home network to send music around from device to device. Your devices must all be on the same network for this to work.
 DLNA
Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) is an electronics industry-wide group that created the DLNA standard. DLNA uses a bunch of technologies that makes it easier for your DLNA-equipped devices to find and connect to each other. There's a good chance that your home theater system has a couple of DLNA-enabled devices. If it's got a network port, take a look at your manual. You may already have some DLNA components available.
To send audio from your Android or iOS device, you can use Skifta, which is a free app. The app lets you connect from your audio source to your DLNA-capable receiver. You can use XBMC as your DLNA receiver by turning on UPnP in the settings. You can find that option in XBMC under System &gt; Settings &gt; UPnP.
You can build a low-cost DLNA receiver by using a Raspberry Pi computer. We showed you how to make an XBMC machine with the Raspberry Pi in " Know How... 31 Make a Raspberry Pi Media Center with XBMC ."
DLNA also cannot stream to more than one receiver at the same time.
 Airplay
Apple has a variant using DLNA that it calls Airplay. You can stream from iOS devices to Airplay-enabled speakers. However, you don't have to use Apple products to use Airplay.
The latest version of XBMC allows it to receive Airplay audio and video. You can use a Raspberry Pi or other machine running XBMC at each speaker. Additionally, you can try iPlay Audio, which turns your Android device into an Airplay receiver. In our tests, it was a bit buggy. Try out the free version .

 Installing Ubuntu Touch
What is Ubuntu Touch? Canonical says "The Ubuntu Touch Developer Preview is intended to be used for development and evaluation purposes only. It is an experimental development snapshot that can potentially brick your device." The whole process takes about thirty minutes.
You'll need a machine running Linux, a supported device and about 30 minutes. Right now, the only supported devices are Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 4, 7, and 10.
Your best resources for instructions are from Ubuntu itself . Follow these directions to the letter. Restoration to stock Android is also there.
 Google+ Community Spotlight
Loved the show on the Raspberry Pi and XBMC. I have had it running on my Pi for a few weeks now and have been watching lots of programming through the TWiT add-on. One feature you didn't mention that I love is the ability to use your TV remote to navigate the interface (including seek/play/pause/stop) using CEC [Consumer Electronics Control] over the HDMI cable.
Of course, it only works if your TV supports CEC. I do use an iOS app sometimes but really like controlling XBMC the same way I control my TV/DVD player/etc.

We'll show you a bunch of ways you can add functionality back to Windows 8.
The Windows 8 interface is a stark departure from Windows 7. The biggest change is the Start screen. Hitting the Windows key brings you to a tiled interface that some people don't want to see. Microsoft doesn't include a way to automatically launch to the desktop, but there is software out there.
 Skip Metro Suite will allow you to start Windows running the desktop instead of the Start screen.
Windows 8 does not have a Start button, instead opting for the Start screen. Classic Shell can bring back a free version of the Start button. It's plenty customizable as well. Classic Shell can also start you off on the desktop.
A paid alternative called Retro UI combines the Win 8 and Win 7 experiences. $5 for a consumer version. You'd be able to run Modern apps (formerly "Metro" apps) on the desktop in resizable Windows.
Microsoft also dropped support for gadgets from Windows 8. You can bring them back with 8GadgetPack . It supports your old Windows 7 gadgets if you'd like.
Windows 8 doesn't have built-in DVD support. VLC to the rescue. It's the swiss army knife of media players. We highly suggest it for any platform.
Media Center is no longer in Windows by default either. You can always buy Media Center from Microsoft. If you've got Windows 8 Pro, it's in Control Panel &gt; Add Features to Windows 8 &gt; I want to buy a product key. It will run you $10, but it's Media Center. However, there is a free option and that's XBMC . The free XBMC runs on a number of platforms and Version 12 includes PVR functionality. XBMC is very powerful and has a bunch of extensions like ways to watch web video.
